    <img id="gondola" src="gondola.jpg" alt="a venetian gondal on a scenic canal">
    <p>our bed and breakfast is located in a typical venetian area, on the second floor of a venetian palace, with private entrance and canal view, close to san marco square.</p>
    <p>the neighbourhood is very beautiful and characteristic, the house is just a footstep away from the most important monuments, churches and shops, with restaurants, pizzerias and bars around the corner.</p>
    <img id="venice" src="venice.png" alt="canal b &#38; b nestled ">    
    <p>take a look at our <a href="rooms.html">comfortable and elegant rooms</a>. each bedroom has a seating area and balcony overlooking the canal.</p>
    <p>enjoy your breakfast in our lovely garden and let our gondel take you on a romantic tour in the canals. visit the islands murano, burano, torcello and lido, the boats are just 5 minutes by foot away.</p>
